Hi Alice,

Thanks for the detailed breakdown. I agree with the proposed timeline.

A few additional points:
- Let's schedule weekly check-ins every Friday
- We should consider adding buffer time for testing
- The client presentation is confirmed for March 15th

Let me know if you need any additional resources.

Best,
Bob
